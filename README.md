# ML with Phishing

The files in this repo will be used for my "Machine Learning with Phishing" series on [my blog](https://andpalmier.github.io/posts/), please refer to the original blog post to have a more pleasant (dark mode included! ðŸ˜ˆ) reading experience.

Please, note that the small version of the dataset contains the 10 '*baseline features*' that were selected in [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025519300763).
